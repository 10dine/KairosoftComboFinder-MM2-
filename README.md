This uses Openpyxl and tkinter libraries.

Its a pretty useless python application. I made it for my own practice and portfolio. Its basically a tkinter GUI python app that takes an item from a dropdown list and searches through an excel sheet and prints the rows which the item is in, in a label. The dropdown list is also from the excel list but on different sheet.
